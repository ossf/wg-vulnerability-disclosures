# **Vulnerability Disclosures**

[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

The OpenSSF Vulnerability Disclosures Working Group seeks to help improve the overall security of the open source software ecosystem by helping mature and advocate well-managed vulnerability reporting and communication.

## **Objective**

The OpenSSF Vulnerability Disclosures Working Group seeks to help improve the overall security of the open source software ecosystem by helping develop and advocate well-managed vulnerability reporting and communication. We plan on addressing this challenge through the following actions:

- Documenting and promoting reasonable vulnerability disclosure and coordination practices within the OSS ecosystem for component maintainers and community members by providing documented standards and educational materials.

- Identifying vulnerability disclosure pain points for OSS maintainer, consumers, and security researchers and take steps to address them.

- Facilitate the development and adoption of a standards-based OSS Vulnerability Exchange that uses existing industry formats and allows OSS projects of all sizes to be able to report, share, and learn about vulnerabilities within OSS components.

## **Current work**
- [Guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure for open source software projects](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide) to assist projects in handling vulnerabilities.
- [Open Source Vulnerability Schema](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema) - see also [osv.dev](https://osv.dev).
- [OSS-SIRT SIG](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT) - SIG dedicated to update of OpenSSF Mobilization Plan Stream 5 working to create upstream open source incident response team.
- Vulnerability AutoFix SIG (incubating) - Group dedicated to finding best pradctices in disclosing open source vulnerabilities and fixes to projects at scal.e

## **Past Work**
- [Unified list of metadata for vulnerability reports and disclosures](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eZpBk2aIup29KcWwN5MAhvkk60EE_DRt2YRtLo8P0zs/edit?usp=sharing)

## **Antitrust policy**

Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at <http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy>. If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.
