# **Vulnerability Disclosures**

The OpenSSF Vulnerability Disclosures Working Group seeks to help improve the overall security of the open source software ecosystem by helping mature and advocate well-managed vulnerability reporting and communication. 

## **Objective**

The first objectives we're using to track our progress towards that vision are:

- Create a unified format and API for vulnerability reporting (from researchers to maintainers) and drive broad adoption of it across the open source software ecosystem
- Create a unified format, API, and process for coordinated disclosure (from maintainers to users/the world) and drive broad adoption

## **Scope**

- [Unified list of metadata for vulnerability reports and disclosures](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eZpBk2aIup29KcWwN5MAhvkk60EE_DRt2YRtLo8P0zs/edit?usp=sharing)

## **Get Involved**

We communicate on the Vulnerability Disclosure [mailing list](https://lists.openssf.org/g/openssf-wg-vul-disclosures). [Manage your subscriptions to Open SSF mailing lists](https://lists.openssf.org/g/main/subgroups).

## **Meeting Times**

The working group meets every three weeks, on Monday at 7am Pacific. Currently we are using Zoom for working group meetings. The invite is available on the [OpenSSF Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=czYzdm9lZmhwNWk5cGZsdGI1cTY3bmdwZXNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).

Contact [Marcin](mailto:marcin.hoppe@auth0.com) if you wish to be added to the invite list.

Meeting agenda is published prior to the meeting in a GitHub issue with the label `meeting`. The issue contains agenda items and logistics details like date, time, Zoom link and a link to meeting notes document.
