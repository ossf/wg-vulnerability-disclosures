# Agenda & notes

- OSSF migration
- Vulnerability metadata JSON format:
  - Agree on merging the PR
    - Drop PURL in favor of the format used by CVE
      - Ecosystem tag (e.g. “npm”)
      - Package name
      - Version range
    - Allows us to run dependabot on this data
    - JSON schema is the first step
- Next steps on documenting the format
  - Possible collaboration with the security tooling WG
  - Alternatives to consider:
    - Implementation is the implementation
    - IETF-style RFC
      - Might be premature at this point
    - Comments inside the JSON schema directly
    - Provide examples of concrete CVEs
  - Other use cases for the vulnerability format
    - Independent vulnerability database
    - What about smaller communities?
      - OpenJSF
      - Ruby
- MVP Vuln Disclosure Proposal - HackerOne, Github & NodeJS Ecosystem WG
  - Review Node.js Ecosystem workflow
    - Marcin gave an overview of the Node.js Ecosystem Security WG process
  - Discuss identified problems
    - There is value in publishing Maintainer Advisories
      - Increased trust if it comes from the maintainer
      - Maintainer has to be involved and agree there is a vulnerability to fix

# Homework

- @MarcinHoppe to migrate repo contents of OpenSSF repo (https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures)
- @infin8x to get back to the WG about private vulnerability reports feature on GitHub
- @rice to talk to Reed about the Ruby ecosystem
