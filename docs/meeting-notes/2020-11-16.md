## Meeting minutes

- Welcome new members
  - Itay (Aqua Security)
  - Teppei (Aqua Security, Trivy)
  - Dan (Intel)
  - Art (CERT/CC in process of joining OpenSSF)
- Teppei presenting on “Embed CPE names into binaries” ([#73](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/73))
  - Explaining Trivy - open source scanner for artifacts (containers) 
  - This leverages package managers
  - Many official docker images install software using “make”
  - There are issues in - scanners can’t detect within self-compiled binaries - it would need a SBoM for binaries
  - CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) comes in at this point
  - The goal is to associate CPE to Binaries in order to facilitate vulnerability detection
  - Sometimes the binary name is different than the production name
    - Hash based mappings can be prepared in advance - but this requires a database of all versions 
  - NOTE: David (in chat): This kind of thing has been proposed before. Embedding CPE names was previously proposed for OWASP Dependency-check by Dale Visser, including a specification and pull request. It wasn’t accepted at that time, for reasons I don’t agree with. It might be a wise time to discuss again & re-introduce this proposal. See: https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/pull/298
    - Version option based can also be prepared in advance (output needs to be formatted). There is an issue in that “-v” is not standardized
      - True, but embedding the data *within* the binary means that you don’t *need* to standardize “-v”
    - Supporting multiple identifiers seems like a good idea. E.g., be able to embed CPE, puRL, home page URL would be great. I doubt it’d be possible to embed SWID, because that’s a hash, and you can’t embed the hash you still need to calculate, but being able to support other formats would still be an improvement.
  - First proposal: add new CPE name section, ideally in Makefile, but Dockerfile could suffice
  - Proposal Goal: improve accuracy of vulnerability scanners by embed in binaries (useful for host/container scanning), embed in docker labels (useful in container scanning)
- After Presentation:
  - @david-a-wheeler Brings up that this was brought up as a pull request to OWASP dependency check (see here)
  - @kerberosmansour Brings up this could be useful to locate advisories without scanners by utilizing unique identifiers. Notes: cpe is the most used today 
  - Discussion bringing up SWIDs are being suggested to be used but they lack versions 
  - Notes: having both current (cpe) and future (swid) covers current and future
  - SBoM data would help everyone be able to accomplish the goal (find vulns without scans)
    - Chicken and egg better info helps builds sbom and sbom helps find vulns 
  - How do we get information (today’s topic) from software that lacks a package manager (i.e. using make) - people have pre-compiled binaries they download (or may build). And the extra data package managers would provide is then not present. 
  - CPE embedding could be embedded into containers because they are wrapped but this is harder with ruby, perl, python source based languages all choosing different ways to embed the information
    - Teppei notes some of these have standardized data today
- We need to decide next steps as a WG
- Art Manion (& Emily Sarneso), CERT/CC (a Federally Funded Research & Development Center (FFRDC) (child of Software Engineering Institute (SEI)) (Emily is lead developer) - help other organizations do the work better of aggregation of vulnerabilities)
  - Intend to release as OSS a project that’s basically a bug tracker, but.... They want to track for multiple vendors. Created “VINCE”
  - VINCE =  Security vulnerability issue tracker designed to support multiple affected suppliers/projects & multiple relevant researchers (most issue trackers only work for one supplier), enables private reports/discussion, web-based instead of email-based.
  - Someone can file a ticket; they can then decide whether or not to accept that ticket; if they accept the case, they can notify other vendor as part of “case discussion”
  - Coordinated disclosure practice we have been doing with a mismatch of tools, lots of email, PGP, GPG, lotus notes… They have been looking for a better tool solution - nothing off the shelf fit. They decided to go with custom build.
  - VINCE (https://www.kb.cert.org/vince/) program started in end of May
  - Internet facing tracker with security and privacy
  - Multi Vendor component was a major limit preventing off the shelf
  - The bugs have dozens to hundreds of vendors - they need to track if each person has responded if they are impacted and if yes if they have patched it
  - Modern option Bugcrowd or HackerOne
  - Only CERT runs VINCE, plans to open source it and let others run their own copies of it
  - People can submit a bug, logged in or not (anon)
  - Each day go through tickets
  - Triage daily
  - Ideally conversations happen within (https) vince, want to move away from PGP and email
  - Case opened, invite vendors
  - All vendors know who is in the case
  - Coordination for a vulnerability happens here
  - This is also content tool (they call it a vulnerability note)
  - Overall they are open to anyone submitting anything
  - They pick cases based on where they can put most value
  - Many vendors handle their own cases (more and more over the years)
  - Multi vendor cases don’t have an easy answer and that is where they focus (upstream when many share a common tech)
  - Emily Demo (vince - vulnerability information and coordination environment)
    - Submitting vuln report
    - Showing the ticket those come in as
    - Will either take it (make a case) or not (may just need to provide reporter contact information for a vendor)
    - Case - in vince com - is where discussions happen, similar to a message board. You can tag the report and ask for more information for example. That will send an email notification. 
      - Ask vendors to state their status (affected)
    - VINCE: https://www.kb.cert.org/vince/
    - https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/VIN/VINCE+Documentation we plan to open source VINCE
  - Question: have others asked to run this? Yes they have had interest. This will be an option when this becomes open-source.
    - Next steps build our API further and what does a common API coordination tool look like? 
- @stevespringett Showing how SBoM supports vulnerability remediation tracking
  - This is how CycloneDX does things today
  - They do standards development
  - Risk first
  - The default schema is only static factual data and it is extensible.
  - The extensions provides optional capabilities (such as vuln disclosure) for things that change over time.
  - Security first SBoM spec
  - Supports remediation and disclosure elements
  - Component Remediation
    - Can denote a patch versus upgrade, and say which vuln a patch resolves 
    - Does not try to communicate effectiveness of a remediation (it’s an opinion of someone at a point in time)
    - Does not describe build, runtime, or environmental remediation - out of scope for spec
  - Vulnerability disclosure
    - A component can be impacted by multiple vulnerabilities (using an extension)
    - Refers to package url - cvss v2 or v3 and other risk ratings supported
  - Disclosure notes
    - Vulnerability extension communicates instances of vulnerabilities
    - Vulnerabilities can only apply to a single component
    - Possible risk rate each instance independently
    - May increase BoM size as you are unable to reuse vulnerabilities
    - They are working with Snyk to improve
  - Note: there are many incompatible formats for describing the vulnerabilities, we may as a group want to look at this. (we do have a task to compile our list then look at similarities and differences)
- @MarcinHoppe: we also need to indicate what pain points (use cases) are being addressed in addition to formats  
- Art's list of formats - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq1hXLPusfcLstSCGYrzRYkI3qeeEj_hLVipJBgoWEA/edit?pli=1#gid=0 
- @kerberosmansour list: https://www.ten-inc.com/ise/northeast/default_2017.asp (The Vulnerability Scoring Model (VxSx) Project)
- @dcmiddle - is working with other OSS groups and is trying to pair up contributors and groups (requirements from the real world) - captis? Young group found they don’t understand vulnerability disclosure - need one to two volunteers monday 6pm pacific to show up and help them out. Reach out via slack or email - dan.middleton@intel.com 

## Action items
