## Notes

The list of metadata we believe should be included in a vulnerability disclosure (and the subset that we would like reports to contain) is now in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eZpBk2aIup29KcWwN5MAhvkk60EE_DRt2YRtLo8P0zs/edit#gid=0).

## Appendix

### Am I actually vulnerable?: npm

1. Affected version(s) 
    1. Is the version I use within the affected versions?
2. Impacted Methods/API calls. 
    2. Example: [https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/720](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/720)
    3. The example mentions that the vulnerability is only for the `randomDigits(). `If for example the library consumer uses only the `randomString()`, they know they are not affected.
3. (optional) specific language/platform versions that make this library vulnerable
    4. Example: [https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:base64url:20180511](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:base64url:20180511)
    5. The example mentions that the vulnerability exists only in Node &lt;=4
4. Reproduction steps/PoC code
    6. Example: [https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/337](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/337)
    7. Reproduction steps or PoC code helps the library consumer in their attempt to reproduce the vulnerability in their system.
5. npm - is it in the devDependencies section?
6. npm - does the vulnerability only work when [deployed in a server](https://twitter.com/slicknet/status/1242846979995996160) vs. client-side?
7. Could a CodeQL query be provided to tell you if you use the vulnerable code paths?
8. Is there a WAF (e.g. Mod Security) rule that can help block this attack till it’s remediated in the application?


### Am I actually vulnerable?: Google

Sources of reports:

*   security@ email address
*   Bug bounty program, vulnerability disclosure program
*   Penetration test
*   DAST or SAST tools like Qualys, Nessus, AWS Inspector, Rubocop
*   Intrusion detection
*   RSS feeds
*   Vendor Advisories
*   Email
*   Package Vendors
*   AWS Inspector
*   Snyk
*   Rennovate/Dependabot/etc

What are the steps/questions to ask?

*   Triage
    *   Is the vulnerability part of a library I have installed?
        *   Is the integrity of the package maintained?
            *   If yes, assume vulnerable
            *   If no:
                *   Does my code mitigate the vulnerability?
                *   Does my code increase exploitability?
    *   Is the vulnerability part of a system I am using?
        *   If yes, assume vulnerable
    *   Is the vulnerability part of code I have written?
        *   Can I reproduce the vulnerability?
            *   If yes, assume vulnerable
        *   Is this a theoretical risk / best practice?
            *   Is it exploitable?
                *   If yes, assume vulnerable
                *   If no, determine potential impact and make assumptions based on that
*   Severity/Priority
    *   What asset is this vulnerability in?
    *   What is the severity based on the environment?
    *   How do I use this package? 
        *   What parts do I actually connect to?
        *   Is that part vulnerable?
    *   Is this exploit in the wild?
*   Mitigation
    *   Is there a patch available?
    *   Can I apply the patch quickly?
    *   Can I mitigate the vulnerability another way?
*   Incident Investigation
    *   How long was I vulnerable? Was this exploited?
